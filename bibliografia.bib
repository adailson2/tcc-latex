Abstract = {Software testing is important component of software quality assurance as programmer can get view of specification, design and coding of the software. The main aim is to minimize the number of faults detected in software. Test case generation can be considered as an optimization problem. Test case data can be generated automatically and also with random testing. Aim of test case generation is to satisfy particular criteria. We can generate test case with help of genetic algorithm. Further comparison can be done between random testing and genetic algorithm. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
